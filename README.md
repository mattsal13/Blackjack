# Blackjack
Simulation of the game in python. Eventually working to derive the basic strategy table, hopefully. 
Some reconsolidating of the functions needs to be done, ie like some of the functions that are defined inside of 
round() should probably be outside of it. Also will need to define something like game() with multiple rounds
keeping track of what's in the deck.
